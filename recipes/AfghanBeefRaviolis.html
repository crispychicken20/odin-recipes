    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, stir together yogurt, mint, garlic. Refrigerate
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet over medium heat, cook ground beef and onions until meat is browned, stirring occasionally to crumble; drain fat.
            Stir in 1 cup water, carrot, salt, black pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoons coriander, and 1/2 teaspoon cumin; simmer uncovered for 30 minutes or until water evaporates.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lay out wonton wrappers on aluminum foil. 
            Mound two large spoonfuls of beef mixture in the center of one wrapper. 
            Dip a finger in water and trace it around all four edges.
            Lay a second wonton wrapper on top of the first, and press on all edges to seal.
            Roll up the edges to create a round, hat-shaped ravioli. Repeat, making 13 ravioli.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place ravioli in steamer and steam 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, mix together the yellow split peas, 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon coriander, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, chicken bouillon, and 1 1/2 cups of water in a saucepan. 
            Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium-low heat for about 45 minutes, or until it reaches a thick slurry-like consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, in the large skillet, mix remaining beef mixture with 2 tablespoons water, tomato paste, and 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes. 
            Simmer over low heat until liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve, spread yogurt on a serving plate. 
            Top with ravioli, and top again with split pea mixture. Finally, top with tomato and beef mixture. Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
